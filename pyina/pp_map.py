"""
Very basic parallel processing support

Implements a work-alike of the builtin map() function that distributes
work across many processes.  As it uses Parallel Python to do the
actual multi-processing, code using this must conform to the usual PP
restrictions (arguments must be serializable, etc.)

    Although the calling semantics should be identical to
    __builtin__.map (even using __builtin__.map to process
    arguments), it differs in that it returns a generator instead of a
    list.  This enables lazy evaluation of the results so that other
    work can be done while the subprocesses are still running.
