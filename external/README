# NOTES ON 'external' packages:

The current implementation of pyina required slight modifications
to one external dependency. These dependencies are provided in the
`pyina.external` directory for users installing without setuptools.

To install the external packages:
    $ unzip mpi4py-1.2.2-pyina.zip
    $ cd mpi4py-1.2.2-pyina
    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py install

DEVELOPER's NOTES:

'mpi4py' was edited to install better on the mac
(see line 1411 in mpi4py/conf/mpidistutills.py)
